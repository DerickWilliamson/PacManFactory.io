# pacmen Factory
This project was inspired and lead by the MIT certificate program I am currently in. The target goal of this exercise was taking user input to spawn images and animation with random variables to move them at different speeds and inputs.

#Running the Program
Simply open the .io above and the file will automatically run on command. Click spawn pacman to make one, click start game to start their movemenht.

#Road Map
Not until after the certificate program is over but the planned updates are as follows:
I plan to:
click to make dots,
add update tracking to make the pacman move towards said dots,
impliment a hunger system where if a pacman goes to long without "eating" a dot it will delete itself.

possibly:
use machine learning to make the pacman better at finding the dots when placed. I theorize this will result in the pacman chasing the mouse, or them moving back to middle after eating.
